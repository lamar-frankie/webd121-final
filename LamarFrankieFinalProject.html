                Machine Learning is a type of computer programming that flips the traditional programming model on its head. Androids and Atomatons have been apart of literature and media for decades. The idea of
                machines that could think and act on their own has captivated human imagination and will not let go. Thankfully, technology is finally starting to catch up with the fantasy. In traditional computer programming the machines actions are limited to those written in a programming language. According to Andrew Ng, Standord University Computer Science Department and Google Brain Project, machine learning is the process of giving a computer the freedom to take actions that are not explicitly programmed.

                Machine Learning Engineers are the driving force advancing this computer science niche. Machine Learning Engineers develop new algorithms, think up new use cases, and conduct research. In addition to new software developments Machine Learning Engineers also work hardware manufactures to push the limits of computer chips and squeeze more and more compute power out of it. Machine Learning Engineers work in Commercial Businesses, Governments, and Educational Institutions.
