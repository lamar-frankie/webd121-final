                Machine Learning Engineers are a subset of Software Engineers which are themselves a subset of Computer Engineers. Machine Learning Engineers posses many of the same skills as traditional engineering disciplines. In addition to these Machine Learning Engineers can create and evaluate algorithms, create statistical models, and clean datasets.

                Machine Learning Engineers must posses a deep understanding of statistics, linear algebra, computer science, and calculus. Machine Learning Engineers regularly take courses, attend conferences, and read white-papers on topics of interest. O'Reilly Media holds 2 Artificial Intelligence conferences in North America every year. Topics include: Design thinking for AI, Reinforcement Learning Applications, and AI strategy (Source: https://conferences.oreilly.com). All of these topics are relevant for Machine Learning Engineers.
