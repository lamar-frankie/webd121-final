    Machine Learning Engineer is still a very specialized field. A quick google search reveals that there a no undergraduate degrees in Machine Learning currently being offer in the US. The are several programs at the Master's and Doctoral level. So what should and undergraduate study if they want to pursue a careen in Machine Learning? According to Georgia Institute of Technology, at a minimum admission into their Master's Program with a Concentration in Machine Learning a prospective student must posses a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field such as engineering or math. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has a similar requirement for admission into their Master's program as well.
